    "\n",
    "Object means real world entities like Car, Bike, Dog etc.  \n",
    "It has 2 things:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Properties (data variables)\n",
    "- Behaviors (data methods)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Abstraction\n",
    "\n",
    "- It hides the internal implementation and shows only essential functionality to the user.\n",
    "- It can be achieved through abstract and interface class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Increase security and confidentiality.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Encapsulation\n",
    "\n",
    "- Encapsulation bundles the data and the code working on that data in a single unit, also knows as DATA-HIDING.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Achieve to encapsulation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Declare a variable in a class as private.\n",
    "- Provide a public getter  and setter  methods to modify and view the value of the variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Loosely coupled code.\n",
    "- Better access controller and security.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Inheritance\n",
    "\n",
    "- Capability of a Class to inherit properties from their Parent Class.\n",
    "- It can inherit both functions and variables, so we do not have to write them again in child classes. \n",
    "- This can be achieved using extends  keyword or through an interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Inheritance:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Single Inheritance.\n",
    "- Multilevel Inheritance.\n",
    "- Hierarchical Inheritance.\n",
    "- Multiple Inheritance - through `interface`, we can resolve the diamond problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Code reusability\n",
    "- We can achieve Polymorphism using Inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Polymorphism\n",
    "\n",
    "- Poly mean Many and Morphism means Form.\n",
    "- The same method, behaves differently in different situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Polymorphism:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Compile Time / Static Polymorphism / Method Overloading. [same method name with different parameters]\n",
    "- Run Time / Dynamic Polymorphism / Method Overriding.\n",
    "- Operator overloading isn't supported by Java.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Object Relationships\n",
    "\n",
    "- Is-a Relationship\n",
    "    - Achieved through Inheritance\n",
    "    - Example: DOG is-an Animal\n",
    "    - Inheritance forms an is-a relation between its parent-child classes.\n",
    "- Has-a Relationship\n",
    "    - Whenever an Object is used in Other Class, it's called HAS-A relationship.\n",
    "    - Relationships could be one-one, one-many, many to many.\n",
    "    - Examples\n",
    "        - School has Students.\n",
    "        - Bike has an Engine.\n",
    "        - School has Classes.\n",
    "    - Association: The relationship between 2 different Objects.\n",
    "        - Aggregation: Both Objects. Can survive individually, which means the ending of one object will not end other objects.\n",
    "        - Composition: The ending of One object will end another object."
